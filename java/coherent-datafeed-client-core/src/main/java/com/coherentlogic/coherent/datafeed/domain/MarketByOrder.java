/**
 * A domain class containing market by order data.

 * https://customers.reuters.com/a/knowledgecentre/resolution.aspx?id=1002673
 *
 * Issue
 *
 * What market depths are available in Thomson Reuters Tick History (TRTH)?
 *
 * Resolution
 * 
 * The data on Thomson Reuters Tick History (TRTH) is provided by the Reuters
 * IDN feed. The feed provides the following Market Depth data:
 * 
 * Level 1 - Top of Book
 * 
 * This data contains the best bid/offer for each instrument and provides
 * visibility of the best price. The data provided is in a similar instrument as
 * trading information is.  
 * 
 * Market by Price - Market Depth
 * 
 * The data provides a summary of the market based upon price levels at the top
 * of the market (typically five to ten levels). The data is provided in a
 * different instrument code to the Level 1, whereas in TRTH, the data is
 * supplied when the Market Depth view is selected. The Market Depth data is
 * provided in snaps at a regular interval (for example, five second snaps).
 * Market depth data does not provide visibility of every order.
 *
 * Market by Order - Full Order Book
 *
 * Data is not available on TRTH. This equates to a full un-aggregated order
 * book including every quote on the instrument.  A new product, Thomson Reuters
 * Tick History Full Order Book will provide Market by Order data for a limited
 * number of North American and European feeds.
